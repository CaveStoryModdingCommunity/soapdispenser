Fluff8836 posted a map of this version, but the link is dead. Based on pictures later in the thread, it may have just been the early april map + the flame rooms from the may map | Lost |

| [2010.11.13](https://forum.cavestory.org/threads/i-really-really-think-pixel-is-making-a-new-game.2056/post-89512) | Map updated | Swords and Goals no longer have safe zones, Snail (probably) lives at (0,6) | |
| [2010.11.19](https://forum.cavestory.org/threads/i-really-really-think-pixel-is-making-a-new-game.2056/post-89515) | Fluff8836 documents breaking soaprun | Switching colors caused lag and let monsters go on the safe zone so corpses could be spawned there. Since the snail can't go on the safe zone, any corpses spawned there were permanent. Someone else managed to die on a solid block, causing it to change into one with a white border(!) |
| [2010.12.11](https://forum.cavestory.org/threads/i-really-really-think-pixel-is-making-a-new-game.2056/page-22#post-89535) | ~~God~~ Fluff8836 Floods the Earth | Pixel would need to restart the server to clean this up | |
